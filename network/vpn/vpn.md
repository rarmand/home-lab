### What is VPN?

**Virtual Private Network**

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network

A network architecture for secure and encrypted connection between devices and private remote servers over a public network (the Internet).

The connection is often named "tunnel".

Connection is achieved by creating a link between computing devices and computer networks by the use of network tunneling protocols.
____

**Tunneling protocols** - a protocol that allows for a movement of data from one network to another, even over an incompatible network.

A tunneling protocol may, for example, allow a foreign protocol to run over a network that does not support that particular protocol.

____

- VPN hides the user's real IP address and location

- VPN servers can bypass geographic restrictions by routing traffic through servers in other countries

- VPN servers essentially act as your proxies on the internet. Because the demographic location data comes from a server in another country, your actual location cannot be determined 

- all internet traffic sent through a VPN is encrypted, protecting from unauthorized access and eavesdropping

- most VPN services do not store logs of your activities. Some providers record your behavior, but do not pass this information on to third parties. This means that any potential record of your user behavior remains permanently hidden

Types of VPN:

- **Remote Access VPN** - the most common for home users - allows individual users to securely connect to a private network from anywhere using encrypted tunnels, often used by employees working remotely to access company resources; 

- Site-to-Site VPN - connects entire networks (such as offices in different locations) together, enabling secure data exchange between corporate sites over the internet using encryption;

- Cloud VPN - provides secure access to cloud resources and services by encrypting connections between users or branch offices and cloud-based infrastructure; 

- SSL VPN - uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol to enable secure connections through web browsers, often used for remote access without requiring dedicated VPN client software;

- Double VPN - routes your internet traffic through two encrypted VPN servers in sequence, offering enhanced privacy and security by doubling data encryption.
Each type addresses different connectivity and security needs in modern digital environments.

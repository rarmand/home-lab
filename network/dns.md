### ISP - Internet Service Provider 

At first, we get any information about domains and IP addresses "from our ISP" - ISP's DNS resolver.

The default DNS server - DNS resolver, provided by ISP - keeps copies of information from other higher-authority DNS servers.

Such DNS servers are like a phonebook of the web - we have contact numbers to specific domains. Such a DNS Resolver allows or disallows us to contact with specific addresses.

"Some DNS servers cache frequently accessed domains to speed up the resolution process. Others employ encryption and filtering to block malicious websites and prevent cyber threats."

### DNS infrastructure

DNS infrastructure primarily involves two key types of servers: recursive and authoritative. Recursive DNS servers serve as intermediaries between users and the Internet’s vast DNS database.

When a user types a website address, the recursive server takes the request and searches through the DNS hierarchy to find the correct IP address, caching results for faster responses in the future. Authoritative DNS servers, on the other hand, hold the definitive records for specific domains.

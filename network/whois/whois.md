In PL, NASK is a provider of registered domain names with .pl country code registry. 

**WHOIS lookup** is a directory that lists important details about a domain:

- **Registrant Name** - the individual or organization that owns the domain.

- **Registrant Contact** - email and phone number for inquiries or disputes.

- **Domain Registration Date** - the date the domain was initially registered.

- **Domain Expiration Date** - the date the domain registration officially expires.

- **Nameservers** - the DNS details that direct traffic to the appropriate web hosting service.

Due to privacy concerns, some registrants use services that hide their information in the WHOIS lookup results.

The information stored in the WHOIS database is held in various locations and managed by domain registrars. Each domain registrar and registry manages specific TLDs (Top-Level Domains) such as .com and .net, ensuring that every detail is precise and well-updated.
